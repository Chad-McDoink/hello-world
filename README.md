# hello-world
My first repository for all things Gitty and Hubby

Hi, I'm Chad (but seriously my name is <i>not</i> Chad). You get it though. I work in Ad Tech and use GitHub to explore industry docs and specs. I've worked across a large portion of the industry including experiences within agencies, brands, and tech providers. I've been both an advertiser and a publisher and there's one thing I've learned: y'all are <b>nuts</b>. Smooches!
